To create a simple Yoga Audio web application based on the provided requirements, I've broken down the project into actionable tasks, user stories, and prioritized features for development. I've also included effort estimates for each part of the project.

### Epic: Yoga Audio Web Application

4. **User Story 4: Store Audio Files**
   - **Description**: As a developer, I want to store yoga session audio files in the application so that they are easily accessible for playback.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Store audio files as .mp3 in the `wwwroot` directory.
     - [ ] Ensure paths to audio files are correctly linked to the playback controls.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Effort Estimate**: 2 story points

5. **User Story 5: Deploy to IIS**

   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Deploy the application on IIS.
     - [ ] Ensure the application is accessible with proper web hosting configuration.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Effort Estimate**: 4 story points

6. **User Story 6: Ensure a Clean and Minimal Design**

   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - [ ] Implement a clean and minimal user interface design.
     - [ ] Consistent styling across all pages and components.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Effort Estimate**: 3 story points

### Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Features Implementation**
   - Focus on implementing the list display, audio playback, and categories filter.
   - User Stories 1, 2, and 3.

2. **Phase 2: Data Management and Storage**
   - Store audio files and ensure data is loaded correctly.
   - User Story 4.

3. **Phase 3: Deployment**
   - Set up and deploy the application on IIS.
   - User Story 5.

4. **Phase 4: UI/UX Refinement**
   - Refine the UI design for a clean, minimal look.
   - User Story 6.

### Additional Notes

- Consider using ASP.NET Core Blazor Server to take advantage of server-side rendering, which may be more efficient for audio playback requirements.
- Plan for potential iterations based on user feedback and additional features such as user account management or advanced search capabilities in future development phases.
